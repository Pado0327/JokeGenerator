## Functions 
---
*   Get Jokes from Joke API
*   Print Joke (with typing effect)

## What I Learned 
*   I learned how to use asynchronous fetch request instead of using the promise code to fetch API. The promise function is quite reliable, but the chaining of .then()'s might lead to callback hell. Although the async and await function is not fully supported by all browsers, it provides better readability.
